      <h2>Discover</h2>
      <p>
        "We shall also discover something about ourselves and the situation in which we are living" I like this quote because it's true. While art can tell us a lot about time, examining how we examine art is important too. It can tell us a lot about how times are changing, how we interpret and spread information, etc. The title, "I free myself for today and for ever from human immobility" is from a film maker that Berger references in this part. I've never thought about the perspectives of our machines and technology, but it's interesting. Especially the aspect about humans' immobility. Especially, this quote being so old, the speaker might not have envisioned the technology we have now and how easy it can be to reach people and spread information.

      <h2>Building</h2>
      <p>
        It was interesting to hear Berger comment on how buildings (rather, the builders and artists, etc.) used to incorporate art so fundamentally within them. I feel like now, art is used as something that adds charm or flair, which is definitely appreciated, don't get me wrong, but it does seem different from how Berger described it. Almost sadder? Now, I feel we hardly see the same sentiment in a building's art unless it's like, an old family owned place with pictures on the walls dating back years and years...

      <h2>Fundamental</h2>
      <p>
        Does the transportable nature of paintings-turned-pictures make the painting less valuable? Something Berger made a comment on. It makes me think about art now, and how we're moving into AI art. Does the fact that it's generated by AI make it worth less? I guess we should consider what it's worth, and to who.

        Berger talked about the silence and stillness of a painting being basically fundamental to it, or how we interpret and view it. The meaning of a painting can and will change if we focus on different places within a painting. It's weird to see it happen in front of you while watching the segment. Even having Berger discuss the music changing the meaning of a painting was interesting. I find the music wasn't subtle as Berger said it was, but going from silence to music, that makes sense. How the painting is focused upon, the speed or cut of the images together also changes things. Makes it more dynamic, even if it is all one stationary image.

      <h2>Interpret</h2>
      <p>
        Seeing how the younger children interpreted a painting was interesting as well. They can all have different ideas or opinions, backed by their own reasons, but shaped by their own experiences and how they see the world around themselves.

        I like that Berger acknowledges the fact that we have no say over what he is presenting or how, all we can do is sit and take in the information. It's nice that he's talking about the dialogues and words of a painting, even though there is nothing verbal about them. How we interpret them gives them a story, shaped by our meaning or connection of things, ideas, etc. in our minds. 
        <break></break>
        Overall, I enjoyed watching this. It's interesting to compare what Berger is saying to the lives we have now, with even more advanced technology and different ways of thinking and viewing the world.
